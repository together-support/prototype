    <h1>UI Prototypes</h1>
    <ol>
    CSS Grid vs. Table
    <li><a href="grid/grid.html">CSS Grid</a></li>
        <ul>
            Notes:
            <li>Zoom in three sizes</li>
            <li>Avatar pops out from the opposite end when it goes beyond the edge. Feels useful especially when the number of cells increase.</li>
            <li>The avatar moves around through the changing value of <i>grid-row-start</i>. Read online that in order to animate between cells, need to use something like the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/animating-layouts-with-the-flip-technique/">FLIP technique.</a> But actually found a work around that's simpler.</li>
            <li>Code needs clean up.</li>
          </ul>
    </ol>
